      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        The choice between urban and rural habitation is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including economic opportunities, lifestyle preferences, social dynamics, access to essential services, and psychological well-being. Urban areas offer a fast-paced, resource-rich environment with abundant job prospects, advanced healthcare, superior educational institutions, and diverse cultural experiences, making them attractive to those seeking career growth and social engagement. However, they also come with challenges such as high living costs, overcrowding, pollution, and an increased level of urban life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost 60% of people are willing to choose Urban as their residential place with the majority key factor being jobs, and 30% are willing to choose Rural with the key factor being nature.
